# CompetitiveCatalog üíªü•á

Welcome to CompetitiveCatalog! This is my personal journey into the world of competitive programming that I, the repository owner, started in 2023. This repository is created not just as a personal journal to document my progress and growth but also as an open-source platform to assist others in their journey. Please note that this repository is a work in progress, and I am continuously updating it as I learn and grow.

## üåü About

CompetitiveCatalog is my personal space to document solutions to challenges I tackle from various online programming platforms such as Codeforces, LeetCode, Topcoder, and many more. The solutions are organized based on the contest names, problem tags, and difficulty levels. I hoope this can be a learning curve for others as well.

---

## üìù Solutions

The solutions I implement are written in multiple programming languages like Java, C++, Python, etc. Each solution comes with a comprehensive explanation of the approach I took, making it easier to grasp the problem-solving strategy. Feel free to browse the solutions, examine the code, and learn from the techniques I used.

## üéì Learning Resources

CompetitiveCatalog is more than just a personal journey; it's a platform for learning. Here's a peek into the resources that you will find as part of my journey:

- **Problem-solving techniques:** As I learn different problem-solving strategies like greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, etc., I share detailed explanations and sample problems for practice.
- **Data structures:** Discover different data structures, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and many more. I provide their implementations and sample applications to understand their functionalities.
- **Algorithms:** Learn about essential algorithms like sorting, searching, graph traversal, etc. from my detailed explanations and code examples.
- **Big O notation:** Follow my learning path on understanding the time and space complexity of algorithms and analyzing them using Big O notation.
- **And more!**
